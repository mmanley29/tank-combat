# TANK COMBAT

# TANK COMBAT is a high intensity 2 player action game. Each player controls one tank. They maneuver around the field trying to line up a shot to shoot their opponent. Each tank can only shoot one round at a time so make sure to line up the perfect shot before taking your shot, it could be your last! Each tank has a limited speed and rotational speed, so make sure to keep yourself safe from opponents rounds.
